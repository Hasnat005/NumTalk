# NumTalk Client

React + Vite single-page app that consumes the NumTalk API.

## Available Scripts

```powershell
npm install       # install deps
npm run dev       # start Vite dev server
npm run build     # type-check + production build
npm run preview   # serve the production build locally
```

Set `VITE_API_URL` in `.env` (defaults to `http://localhost:4000`). The client expects the API to expose its routes under `/api`.

See the repository root `README.md` for full-stack details.
